## Content

Build using Ansible a dev environment with:
- An elasticsearch single node with 1 node that can also host kibana
- A logstash instance 
- A web instance for hosting an application that produces logs in a json format

Use Vagrant or docker for providing instances for dev environment

The environment should be multi environments compliant.
 
After having setup the dev environment, init a test environment with a cluster of elasticsearch having 3 nodes:
- node 1 (master & data) + kibana
- node 2 (master & data)
- node 3 (master & data)

#### Notes
- Organize your code, so it's easily maintainable, code is elegant and readable.
- Your solution should be able to handle multi environment.
 
## Technologies to use
- Ansible
- Vagrant or docker

## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨
- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- Code readability and coding style (PSR).
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The readme should be short and concise, like open source projects readme, it should contain all necessary step to build and make the app running.

## Instructions
- Put more focus on code quality and less on speed
