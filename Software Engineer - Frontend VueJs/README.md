## Context

- You should focus to build a small and concise app the right way using best bractices.

- The Frontend App is based on the [Github REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) as a backend.

- The goal of this test is more to evaluate the way of thinking, design and quality of code (We accept juniors and seniors).

- CSS & colors and templating are not evaluated, use any template, we put interest more on UX and user interactions. 
 
## Technologies to use
 
- VueJs / Javascript
- Typescript
        
## Brief

As a user I authorize my Github Account then I am able to list my repositories with ability to filter by name (with autocomplete).

As a user I select a repository from the list, then it shows the commit history with infinite scroll related to this branch. 
Also I can switch the branch, then the commits listing is refreshed.

## Mockup 

A mockup describing the UI could be helpful for well understanding the brief, available here => https://app.moqups.com/sZB0qKZrxH/view
