## Context

- You should focus to build a small and concise app the right way using best bractices.

- The Frontend App is based on the [Github REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) as a backend.

- The goal of this test is more to evaluate the way of thinking, design and quality of code (We accept juniors and seniors).

- CSS & colors and templating are not evaluated, use any template, we put interest more on UX and user interactions. 
 
## Technologies to use
 
- VueJs / Javascript
- Typescript
        
## Brief

As a user I authorize my Github Account then I am able to list my repositories with some features:
- Filter by name (autocomplete).

As a user I access to two dashboards for a selected repository.
- Commits history Dashboard: a listing of last x commits in a branch (master is default) with ability to select and show commits.
- Pull Requests history: a listing of last Pull Requests with ability to select and show pull requests.

## Features

### Commit history feature

When the user is on commit history page, commits history is displayed in the left side, he can filter by branch name.
when the user selects a particular commit, it append in the right side of the page the preview code changes related to this commit. 

### Last Pull Requests feature

When the user is on last pull requests page, Pull Requests are listed by date desc in the left side.
When the user selects a Pull requests, it appends commits related to this pull request in the right side.
When the user selects a particular commit, it appends a third side in the right with previewing code changes related. 
to the selected commit.
